# QuizApp
Kiara and I wored on this Thurs/Friday and ran into a lot of difficulty implementing our functions. 
Unfortunately Kiara informed me that she was dropping the program on Saturday. Over the course of the weekend I was able to 
Debug and solve a lot of problems. The app isn't fully functional yet but I suspect there are only a couple more lines of
code to debug and I will have met all the requirements on the grading rubric.
